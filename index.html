                        Hello and welcome to my virtual corner of the internet! I am a Master's student at Arizona State
                        University (ASU), where I am diving deep into the exciting world of computer science with a
                        focus on cybersecurity. I've already had some amazing opportunities to apply my knowledge,
                        including a summer internship at Amazon where I honed my skills as a software developer and got
                        to work with a variety of AWS services. Before that, I spent a year at Cognizant as a project
                        associate, where I not only learned to design UI using dotnet but also created apps for both
                        Android and iOS. My undergraduate journey began at College of Engineering Pune (COEP), where I
                        studied Electronics and Telecommunication. When I'm not studying or working, you can usually
                        find me curled up with a mystery novel or self-help book. I'm also a fitness enthusiast and
                        enjoy going to the gym, as well as trying out new things like learning new programming languages
                        or practicing my foreign language skills. And let's not forget my love for cooking! I hope you
                        enjoy reading about my adventures and journey here on my website.

                        <h4>Arizona State University - (Volunteer) Research Assistance</h4>
                        <p>February 2022 - March 2022 </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Researching 5G MANO:</strong><p>As a volunteer Research Assistant, I demonstrated my knowledge and understanding of 5G MANO by researching
                                3GPP TS
                                28.531 and TS 28.532 Release 15 (R15) to achieve the management and scheduling of 5G network slices. This
                                project
                                involved reviewing technical specifications and analyzing how they could be implemented in real-world
                                scenarios. Through
                                this work, I was able to deepen my understanding of 5G technology and contribute to the team's overall
                                research
                                objectives.</p></li>
                            <li><strong>Conducting Thorough Analysis:</strong><p>As a part of my role, I conducted a thorough analysis of the 5G MANO test pad, identifying potential flaws
                                or backdoors
                                and composing test cases and scripts to confirm vulnerabilities (if any) in the system. This project
                                required a high
                                level of attention to detail and the ability to think critically about complex systems. The outcomes of this
                                project
                                demonstrated my ability to identify potential security threats and mitigate them through careful testing and
                                analysis.</p></li>
                            <li><strong>Contributing to Research Team:</strong><p>As a member of the research team, I contributed by identifying security vulnerabilities and potential
                                weaknesses in the
                                5G network orchestration system. I proposed solutions to improve the security and reliability of the network
                                based on my
                                findings. This project required strong communication skills, the ability to work collaboratively, and a deep
                                understanding of complex systems. Through this work, I was able to make a meaningful contribution to the
                                team's research
                                objectives.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Overall, this experience as a Research Assistant at Arizona State University showcases my expertise in 5G
                            technology,
                            security analysis, and research methodology. I have experience in analyzing technical specifications, conducting
                            thorough analysis, and proposing solutions to improve the security and reliability of complex systems. These
                            skills and
                            experiences demonstrate my ability to work collaboratively, solve complex problems, and make meaningful
                            contributions to
                            the industry.</p>
